# HORISEON

## Purpose
As a marketing agency we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

## Website
ttps://brivera14.github.io/Horiseon-Project/

## Visual Description Of The Project

The changes that you are going to watch are the below:
*GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
*WHEN I view the source code
*THEN I find semantic HTML elements
*WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
*THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
*WHEN I view the image elements
*THEN I find accessible alt attributes
*WHEN I view the heading attributes
*THEN they fall in sequential order
*WHEN I view the title element
*THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

As proof of the modification you can see the first image where are the code of the old repitory
and in the second image you can see the updated codes.
